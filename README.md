Hi! Deshon here!
I am going to be uploading new and even revised old projects here to my 
github as I am a lot more experienced than when i decided to become a 
developer a little under a year ago. Thank you for checking out my work!

Here I build a simple calculator application. Thank you to Tim R. (TWT) for helping me master React!
